# What are keywords?
All programming languages have keywords, keywords are part of the vocabulary of a programming language. They are reserved, thus, can only be used to do what they were intented to do.
</br>We can all reserved keywords on the website <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword">"cpp reference"</a>

# Keywords
C++ has 90 keywords in total, Java has 50, C has 32, and python 33. In general, the more keywords a programming language has, the more complex "grammar", some keywords are less used than others, and some, "never" used at all

## Keywords used last lesson
<a href="../section4-GettingStarted/01-WritingOurFirstProgram/">Last lesson</a> we have already used some of the c++ keywords, they are:

## Stream Insertion keyword
One of the keywords we have already used is the stream insertion operator(<<).
<br>std::cout<<"What is your favorite number?"std::endl;
<br>This keywords inserts whatever is on the right hand side into the left hand side.

## Extraction Operator keywords
This keyword, takes something from the console, and extracts it into a variable(>>)
<br>std::cin>>favNumber;

## Double colon
This keyword, is the scope resolution operator (:)
<br> std::cout<<"What's you favorite number?"<<std::endl;

## Many more
By using multiple of these keywords, we end up creating something known as syntax. Syntax is the structure and the meaning of the program.

# What are comments in code?
Comments are programmable readable text, are often explations of code, annotations, Anything that might be of value to the creator of the program, and other programmers. Comments are removed by the preprocessor before the code reaches the compiler.

# Types
C++ has two comment types

## Single line comment
// A single line comment, a simple comment, everyting until the line ends is not used by the compiler. 

## multiple line comment
/*
<br>
    A multiple line comment can be made like this, and can be made to span several lines
<br>
*/

# Do's and Dont's
Every code should be commented, and every comment shoud make sense.
<ul>
    <li>Comments should be used to explain why something was done, what the code is doing(incase it's not obvious), etc.</li>
    <li>Don't comment the obvious, a useless comment would be to comment "returns 0" on the line "return 0;".</li>
    <li>Keep comment style consistent.</li>
<ul>
